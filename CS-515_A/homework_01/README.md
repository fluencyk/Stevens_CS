# print vs. return
A function owning one or more in-build 'print()' function call(s) may or may not return some value, but a function that has a return keyword certainly returns the typed value.

# bugs and issues
Bug(s):

When coding the first part of the assignment, I met a bug that was a repeated call mistake I made in program design.

Issue(s):

I tried using in-build functions isnumeric() and isdecimal(), which brought some confusing dilemmas.

# resolved issue
So, like in the old days by leveraging old-school ways, I coded on my self-designed algo for the input validation for part A of homework 01.
